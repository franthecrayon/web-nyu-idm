<div class="TOY-STORY">
  <h2 id="toy-story">TOY STORY</h2>
  <p> Toy Story was the first feature film from Pixar Studios. There are now
    four Toy Story films in total, but without the fourth, the trilogy is
    perfect. This movie introduced us to iconic quotes like "To Infinity And
    Beyond!" and characters like Buzz and Woody.</p>

<div class="CARS">
  <h2 id="cars">CARS</h2>
  <p> Life is a highway... on Route 66 in this trilogy of movies. Lightning
    McQueen and Tow Mater are now well known characters as a result of these
    films. While the second movie is terrible, the trilogy creates an amazing
    story that makes you actually cry over a car. </p>

<div class="MONSTERS-INC">
  <h2 id="monsters-inc">MONSTERS INC</h2>
  <p> Mike and Sully are the least scary monsters you'll ever see, but that's
    why you fall in love with them. The prequel movie should not be spoken of,
    but it exists. As we follow along with Boo and the monsters, you are
    entranced by the strange but unique plot. </p>

<div class="UP">
  <h2 id="up">UP</h2>
  <p> I will take no criticism. THIS IS THE BEST PIXAR FILM. From the sense of
    adventure to the TALKING DOGS, this movie cannot be beat. Within the first
    fifteen minutes, you are sobbing over Carl and Ellie. By the end, you cannot
    help but yell "Adventure is out there!" There is no better movie than Up.
    Period.</p>

<div class="THE-GOOD-DINOSAUR">
  <h2 id="the-good-dinosaur">THE GOOD DINOSAUR</h2>
  <p> I do not care what anyone says this is a good movie and it made me cry. It
    is probably the most underappreciated Pixar movie, but Arlo and Spot are
    adorable. My favorite part, however, is the animation. Each scene and
    background is just stunning and makes the movie completely worth watching.

<div class="COCO">
  <h2 id="coco">COCO</h2>
  <p> Un Poco Loco... This movie is beautiful and heartbreaking. It was the
    first Pixar movie that represented the Hispanic heritage and many loved it
    for that reason. The music is incredible and it is such a fun movie. </p>
