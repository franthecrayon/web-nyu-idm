# Object Meditation: My Soulmate Bracelet (Javier's Answers)

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of the object?
Love, Francesca, Safe, Home, Peace (Soon is my replacement for your name if that doesn’t count).

### Are there spatial places the object is associated with?
California and Florida definitely come to mind being it’s where the two of us feel most at home, New York would follow closely after since that’s where your at now, and also the Disney parks. No park in particular, since we’ve visited quite a few of them already, just more of a general feeling.

### What does my object look like?
the centerpiece is the small disk that reads ‘Neither Are You’ from Kylo Ren’s dialogue in the Last Jedi. Just by taking a look at its off white coloring, it becomes very apparent that it glows in the dark when exposed to a lot of light. The small circle is held onto my wrist by black string that I keep tied tightly around my wrist. I find myself constantly threading the excess ends of the string through wrapped portions to keep them from dangling around and being bothersome. The constant fiddling doesn’t annoy me though, it just forces me to give it a glance and remember all of its meaning.

### Feel like?
I run my fingertip over the text constantly since you can feel the indent of where it’s printed. With me fixing the string a lot too I usually feel how coarse it is, but I’m not sure if it was always that way or if it’s because of how much I expose it to water and other elements.

### Sound like?
The object itself doesn’t make any sounds that are particularly unique, but it never fails to bring me back to the memory of her genuine laughter or the sound of her sentimental whispers. It’s usually dependent on the time of day. If it’s earlier and louder I’ll think of our funny conversations about whatever had come up that day, but if it’s darker and more quiet, I’ll usually think of the times when we had been falling asleep, or watching a movie late at night.

### Smell like?
The only smell I find myself ever thinking of with my object is her scent. Especially that of her hair. I’m not sure if it’s the dye in it that gives off such a distinct aroma but it’s one that I constantly find myself missing and wishing to have nearby.

### Where did you get it?
I gifted one bracelet with half of the dialogue to Francesca and given myself the one with the response to hers. I found them on a website she told me about named lifetoken.com (I think?)

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
I would say that there is in fact an order to the emotions the bracelet makes me feel. I usually start with reminiscing on past memories with her, typically the most recent ones. From there, I admittedly become a little downhearted at the thought of how badly I miss her company, but I always bring myself right back up when I remember that she’s not as far as it feels and I’ll see her sooner than I expect.

### Why did you choose it?
I would say this is, of all the physical objects I own, the one that means the most to me. Yes, I have other things that have a sentimental value to them, but nothing quite reaches the same extent as the bracelet.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
I guess the meaning behind it? Most people that ask for an explanation are surprised when they’re told that it’s only half of a message and that there’s more of a larger purpose behind it. I enjoy explaining it to people a lot actually for that reason.

### Is it one of a kind?
It’s one of a kind in the sense that, while you could absolutely purchase a set for yourself, I don’t think anyone has thought to put the same message we had. Even if someone had though, it’s deeper than that. No identical set would have the same meaning, the same story as mine and Francescas. Our love story is as uncommon and special as it gets.

### How do you interact with it?
As far as how I interact with it, I wear it primarily and I don’t ever take it off. But like I mentioned, I find my self constantly tightening and adjusting it so I’m almost constantly reminded of its importance through that. Often times I’ll come home from being out in bright daylight for a long time and it’ll be glowing the brightest it possibly can. The sight of that always puts a smile on my face because I think of it as a metaphor for how radiant she can be.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with?
The only answer would be the one Francesca wears. The two bracelets are married together, they don’t make sense standing alone. Francesca’s ‘You’re Not Alone’ can be read as a singular message but mine is clearly apart of a larger message. While unintentional on my part, I’ve always likened it to how before Francesca, I didn’t really have the best sense of direction or contentment. But when she came along, everything sort of fell into place for me.

### What is a specific memory you have associated with it?
Probably when Francesca and I had first worn them together and were able to take many pictures of the two of us together wearing our respective bracelet. We recreated the pivotal moment of the film that the message originated from for a picture but also took a lot of our own shots. This made me feel really satisfied since it was something I had been eagerly looking forward to since we first got our bracelets.
