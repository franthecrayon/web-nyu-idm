# Object Meditation: My Soulmate Bracelet

### What are 5 words that come to mind when I think of the object?
- Love
- Fravier
- Javier
- Reylo
- Lilac

### Are there spatial places the object is associated with?
My bracelet reminds me of both Florida, where Javier lives, and California,
where I live, and the distance between them.

### What does my object look like?
My bracelet has black strings holding a donut shaped token in the center.
The token has the words "You're Not Alone" engraved on it. The quote is from Star Wars and relates to our favorite couple in the movies and the reason we met.
During the day it looks white, but it glows a greenish color in the dark.

### Feel like?
The bracelet feels like a normal bracelet, but in a more meaningful sense, it
feels like protection, safety, and home.

### Sound like?
There is no sound to the bracelet, but when I look at it, I can hear Javier's
voice in my head.

### Smell like?
There is no smell to the bracelet, but it reminds me of Javier's scent and what
it is like to hug him.

### Where did you get it?
The bracelet was a gift from Javier from a website called LifeToken.com where
you can make customizable bracelets.

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
There are a lot of emotions attached to this object for me. When I was first
given it, Javier and I were only close friends, but now I consider him to be my
soulmate and the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with. I attach
love, safety, and happiness to my bracelet.

### Why did you choose it?
I wear my bracelet every day, and when I take it off, it feels like a part of
me is missing. It is incredibly important to me.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
I see the beginning of Javier and my relationship and how we met in my
bracelet. To others it may just look like a bracelet with a quote, but for me,
it represents my love for Javier and his love for me.

### Is it one of a kind?
While others could make similar bracelets, to me it is one of a kind and could
never be replaced.

### How do you interact with it?
I wear my bracelet and look at it all of the time.

### What are some other objects it does or might have relationships with?
Javier has a matching bracelet that says "Neither Are You" on it to complete
the Star Wars quote that it is based on. There are many other bracelets from
the website with different customizations that are similar to our bracelets.

### What is a specific memory you have associated with it?
Javier and I visited Walt Disney World in January of 2020, and even though we
got the bracelets in March of 2018, we both wore ours. There was a new ride
that opened in Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed land, that we really wanted
to ride. In honor of the ride and our favorite couple in the movies, we
dressed as Rey and Kylo Ren. We did a photoshoot in our outfits and specifically
of our bracelets since they are lines from the characters. We posted these
photos on our Twitters, and the response we received was overwhelming.
Everyone loved our story and was so happy to see our happy relationship.
